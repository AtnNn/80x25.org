# Distributing and running container images on browser without pre-conversion, using `imagemounter` (experimental)

Not only converting container image to Wasm image, container2wasm also allow distributing unmodified container images and running it on browser, etc. (still with CPU emulation, though).

`imagemounter` is a helper tool that enables to pull unmodified container images and mount it into the Linux VM running on Wasm.

The benefits of this approach are that it eliminates the need for image conversion and allows the distributing unmodified container images directly from the container registry to the browser (but the registry needs to enable CORS).

The following tools are used:

- Wasm-formatted Linux VM with emulated CPU: Generated by `c2w --external-bundle out.wasm`. This contains runc but doesn't embed container image. External container image's rootfs needs to be mounted to the VM via 9p.
- `imagemounter.wasm`: This provides functionallity of pulling container images from remote location into the browser/node, and show the rootfs to the above Wasm image via 9p.

## Supported image sources

As of now, the following image server is supported:

- HTTP server that serves OCI container imgaes in [OCI Image Layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.2/image-layout.md): example is https://ktock.github.io/ubuntu-oci-images/ubuntu-22.04-org-amd64
  - Limitations
    - To pull container images into the browser, the server needs to allow CORS access.
- Container registry configured with CORS support
  - Limitations
    - Authentication unsupported (expected to be fixed in the future)
    - To pull container images into the browser, the headers need to be included in the response to support CORS access, for example:
      - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
      - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *`
      - `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Range`
    - Pulling gzip container image is very slow as decompression happens in the Wasm VM. Future version will fix it by performing decompression outside of the Wasm VM.

## Examples

### Starting a server

First, start a page that runs the container:

#### WASI-on-browser approach

Refer to [`../../examples/wasi-browser/`](../../examples/wasi-browser/) for differences between this approach and emscripten approach.

```console
$ mkdir /tmp/outx/
$ c2w --external-bundle /tmp/outx/out.wasm
$ mkdir -p /tmp/out-js3/
$ cp -R ./examples/no-conversion-wasi-browser/* /tmp/out-js3/
$ cat /tmp/outx/out.wasm | gzip >  /tmp/out-js3/htdocs/out.wasm.gzip
$ make imagemounter.wasm
$ cat ./out/imagemounter.wasm | gzip >  /tmp/out-js3/htdocs/imagemounter.wasm.gzip
$ ( cd ./extras/runcontainerjs && npx webpack && cp -R ./dist /tmp/out-js3/htdocs/ )
$ docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8083:80 \
         -v "/tmp/out-js3/htdocs:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/:ro" \
         -v "/tmp/out-js3/xterm-pty.conf:/usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf:ro" \
         --entrypoint=/bin/sh httpd -c 'echo "Include conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf && httpd-foreground'
```

#### emscripten approach (`--to-js` flag)

Refer to [`../../examples/emscripten/`](../../examples/emscripten/) for the basics about `--to-js` flag.

```console
$ mkdir -p /tmp/outx/img
$ c2w --to-js --external-bundle /tmp/outx/img/
$ mkdir -p /tmp/out-js3/
$ cp -R ./examples/no-conversion-emscripten/* /tmp/out-js3/
$ mv /tmp/outx/img /tmp/out-js3/htdocs/img
$ make imagemounter.wasm
$ cat ./out/imagemounter.wasm | gzip >  /tmp/out-js3/htdocs/imagemounter.wasm.gzip
$ ( cd ./extras/runcontainerjs && npx webpack && cp -R ./dist /tmp/out-js3/htdocs/ )
$ docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8083:80 \
         -v "/tmp/out-js3/htdocs:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/:ro" \
         -v "/tmp/out-js3/xterm-pty.conf:/usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf:ro" \
         --entrypoint=/bin/sh httpd -c 'echo "Include conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf && httpd-foreground'
```

### Example on browser + HTTP Server

The server started above can pull an image from HTTP server and run this by specifying it using the query parameter.
For example, you can access to `localhost:8083?image=https://ktock.github.io/ubuntu-oci-images/ubuntu-22.04-org-amd64` which pulls `ubuntu:22.04` stored at https://ktock.github.io/ubuntu-oci-images/ubuntu-22.04-org-amd64 as [OCI Image Layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.2/image-layout.md) and runs it on Wasm.

### Example on browser + Registry

> Note: As described in the above, registry authentication is unsupported as of now so you can't use public registry services. You can try this features using local registry like the following. This limitations is expected to be fixed in the future.

Launch a registry with enabling CORS.

```console
$ mkdir /tmp/regconfig
$ cat <<EOF > /tmp/regconfig/config.yml
version: 0.1
http:
  addr: :5000
  headers:
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ["*"]
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: ["*"]
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: [Content-Range]
    X-Content-Type-Options: [nosniff]
storage:
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry
EOF
$ docker run --rm -d -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 -v /tmp/regconfig/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml --name registry registry:2
$ docker pull ubuntu:22.04
$ docker tag ubuntu:22.04 localhost:5000/ubuntu:22.04
$ docker push localhost:5000/ubuntu:22.04
```

The above registry serves `localhost:5000/ubuntu:22.04` container image.
When you access to `localhost:8083?image=localhost:5000/ubuntu:22.04` (the server started in the previous section), that page fetches `localhost:5000/ubuntu:22.04` container image from the local registry and launches it on browser.

### Example on CLI + HTTP Server (WASI only)

Demo CLI is used for pulling and running the container image.

```console
$ ( cd ./tests/imagemounter-test/ ; go build -o ../../out/imagemounter-test . )
```

The following pulls ubuntu:22.04 stored at https://ktock.github.io/ubuntu-oci-images/ubuntu-22.04-org-amd64 as [OCI Image Layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.2/image-layout.md) and runs it on Wasm.
`/tmp/outx/out.wasm` is the WASI image that contains linux, etc. created in the previous section.

```console
$ ./out/imagemounter-test \
  --image https://ktock.github.io/ubuntu-oci-images/ubuntu-22.04-org-amd64 \
  --stack ./out/imagemounter.wasm \
  /tmp/outx/out.wasm --net=socket=listenfd=4 --external-bundle=9p=192.168.127.252
```

### Example on CLI + Registry (WASI only)

> Note: As described in the above, registry authentication is unsupported as of now so you can't use public registry services. You can try this features using local registry like the following. This limitations is expected to be fixed in the future.

Demo CLI is used for pulling and running the container image.

```console
$ ( cd ./tests/imagemounter-test/ ; go build -o ../../out/imagemounter-test . )
```

First, launch a registry

```console
$ docker run --rm -d -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
$ docker pull ubuntu:22.04
$ docker tag ubuntu:22.04 localhost:5000/ubuntu:22.04
$ docker push localhost:5000/ubuntu:22.04
```

The following pulls `localhost:5000/ubuntu:22.04` container image and runs it on Wasm.
`/tmp/outx/out.wasm` is the WASI image that contains linux, etc. created in the previous section.

```console
$ ./out/imagemounter-test \
  --image localhost:5000/ubuntu:22.04 \
  --stack ./out/imagemounter.wasm \
  /tmp/outx/out.wasm --net=socket=listenfd=4 --external-bundle=9p=192.168.127.252
```

## How to get container image formatted as OCI Image Layout

Docker buildx suppors [exporting image in OCI Image Layout](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#oci).

The following puts `ubuntu:22.04` container image to `/tmp/imageout/` as OCI Image Layout.

```console
$ IMAGE=ubuntu:22.04
$ mkdir /tmp/imageout/
$ docker buildx create --name container --driver=docker-container
$ echo "FROM $IMAGE" | docker buildx build --builder=container --output type=oci,dest=- - | tar -C /tmp/imageout/ -xf -
```

## Lazy pulling of eStargz

imagemounter also supports lazy pulling of eStargz image.

Lazy pulling is a technique of pulling container images for shortening the latency of loading image.
This allows the container to start before the entier image contents becoming locally available.
Instead, necessary chunks of contents (e.g. files) are downloaded from the image server on-demand.

eStargz is a OCI-compatible image format for lazy pulling.
Please refer to [stargz-snapshotter](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter) project for more details.

eStargz image can be created using `docker buildx` command with BuildKit >= v0.10.
Specify `compression=estargz` option.

> NOTE: eStargz-based lazy pulling is also possible from container registries not only from HTTP(S) server.

```console
$ IMAGE=gcc:13.2
$ mkdir /tmp/gcc-13.2-org/ /tmp/gcc-13.2-esgz/
$ docker buildx create --name container --driver=docker-container
$ echo "FROM $IMAGE" | docker buildx build --builder=container --output type=oci,dest=- - | tar -C /tmp/gcc-13.2-org/ -xf -
$ echo "FROM $IMAGE" | docker buildx build --builder=container --output type=oci,oci-mediatype=true,compression=estargz,force-compression=true,dest=- - | tar -C /tmp/gcc-13.2-esgz/ -xf -
```

The following runs the image on browser.
The above eStargz image is located at `http://localhost:8084/gcc-13.2-esgz/`, legacy(non-eStargz) image is located at `http://localhost:8084/gcc-13.2-org/`.
That image can run on browser via `http://localhost:8084/?image=http://localhost:8084/gcc-13.2-esgz/` that fetches the container image into the browser with lazy pulling and launches it.

```console
$ mkdir -p /tmp/out-js4/
$ cp -R ./examples/no-conversion-wasi-browser/* /tmp/out-js4/
$ cp -R /tmp/gcc-13.2-org /tmp/out-js4/htdocs/
$ cp -R /tmp/gcc-13.2-esgz /tmp/out-js4/htdocs/
$ make imagemounter.wasm && cat ./out/imagemounter.wasm | gzip >  /tmp/out-js4/htdocs/imagemounter.wasm.gzip
$ cat out.wasm | gzip >  /tmp/out-js4/htdocs/out.wasm.gzip
$ ( cd extras/runcontainerjs ; npx webpack && cp -R ./dist /tmp/out-js4/htdocs/ )
$ docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8084:80 \
         -v "/tmp/out-js4/htdocs:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/:ro" \
         -v "/tmp/out-js4/xterm-pty.conf:/usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf:ro" \
         --entrypoint=/bin/sh httpd -c 'echo "Include conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf && httpd-foreground'
```
